# Front-End Code Challenge

Welcome to Rhove's front-end code challenge! 

You have one week to complete this challenge and it should take you no longer than 4 hours. We want to be respectful of your time, so at the four-hour mark, submit your challenge and go celebrate a job well done. If there's work you would have completed if you'd had more time (and the app was meant for production), feel free to write that down and submit it along with your code.

Let us know if you have any questions, and good luck!


## Challenge Instructions

Using [layout.jpg](layout.jpg) as a point of reference; create an HTML page of a similar layout. We recognize that working with a flattened image is difficult, but we did not want to expect that our candidates have a license for Sketch. Please use placeholder images from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos) (or another source of your choosing), use [Icofont](https://icofont.com/icons) or skip the icons if it's wiser to invest your time on another aspect of the deliverable.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Demonstrate responsive design, including how you handle images
- Define reusable components
- Overall Browser Support
- Search Engine & Page speed optimization best practices
- Includes more than one commit, each with a thoughtful commit message.
- Work is logically grouped into commits.
